Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches are a way to have different versions of the project in your computer and works, for example, for making alterations of the main project and test it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
