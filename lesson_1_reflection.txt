How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps to find differences between one version of the code and another one, so we can see more easily the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would helps in the way you can view how the code changes with the time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With a commit, we can have a version control of each code, and with google docs everything is saved in a moment, so we can't view the previous versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It makes everything easier for a programmer.
